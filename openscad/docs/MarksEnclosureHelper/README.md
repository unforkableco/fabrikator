# Mark's Enclosure Helper 

This is an OpenSCAD script for generating a two peice hinged box, with
rounded corners, lid, interlocking rims, snap fit, magnet, or screw
closures, and easy places for adding cutouts or additions to any
face. All features are optional and specified by defining a few simple
variables. Included utility functions make perforations, text and
image decorations possible in a single line of code.

Additional parts inculding dovetails and belt clips are also included.

We've tried to make this useable for those less comfortable with or even
new to OpenSCAD. See the "Let's Build a Bee Box" tutorial: 

[LETSBUILD-beebox.md](LETSBUILD-beebox.md).

We've got a large collection of mouths to feed and your generous
donations may help me convince my lovely, loving, and patient wife
that losing me to a coding project for the last month was
worthwhile.
