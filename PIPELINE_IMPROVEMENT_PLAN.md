# Fabrikator 3D Model Generation Pipeline Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve the current 3D model generation pipeline by implementing a multi-agent system that addresses current limitations in part complexity, inter-part coordination, and hardware integration.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Pipeline
1. **Image Generation**: DALL-E generates 3 design concepts
2. **User Selection**: User picks preferred design
3. **Image Description**: OpenAI Vision analyzes selected image
4. **Parts Generation**: Single AI agent generates parts JSON
5. **CAD Script Generation**: Individual scripts per part (isolated)
6. **Retry Mechanism**: Error-based script regeneration

### Identified Problems
- ❌ **Isolated Part Generation**: Parts designed without understanding connections
- ❌ **Missing Technical Context**: No electronic component integration
- ❌ **Superficial Geometry**: Lacks screw bosses, cutouts, alignment features
- ❌ **Single-Pass Design**: No iterative refinement or validation
- ❌ **No Assembly Planning**: Parts don't properly fit together
- ❌ **Insufficient Hardware Integration**: Missing port cutouts and mounting

## Proposed Solution: Multi-Agent Pipeline

    component_id UUID REFERENCES Component(id),
    dimensions JSON,  -- width, height, depth, mounting holes
    ports JSON,       -- USB-C, power, button locations
    constraints JSON, -- clearances, orientations
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE PartInterfaces (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    part_a_id UUID,
    part_b_id UUID,
    interface_type VARCHAR, -- screw, clip, press-fit, snap
    dimensions JSON,
    tolerances JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Assembly validation results
CREATE TABLE AssemblyValidations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    cad_generation_id UUID REFERENCES ProjectCadGeneration(id),
    validation_results JSON,
    issues JSON,
    status VARCHAR, -- passed, failed, needs_refinement
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### New Service Classes

#### HardwareAnalysisService
```typescript
export class HardwareAnalysisService {
    async analyzeComponents(projectId: string): Promise<HardwareSpecs>
    async extractComponentDimensions(component: Component): Promise<ComponentDimensions>
    async identifyPortLocations(imageUrl: string, components: Component[]): Promise<PortMapping>
    async generateMountingConstraints(components: Component[]): Promise<MountingConstraints>

}
```

### Enhanced Prompts

#### Hardware Specs Extraction
```typescript
hardwareSpecsExtraction: `
Analyze the provided electronic components and extract precise technical specifications.

Components: {{components}}
Project Context: {{projectDescription}}

For each component, determine:
1. Exact dimensions (length, width, height in mm)
2. Port locations and orientations (USB-C, power, buttons, LEDs)
3. Mounting hole patterns (diameter, spacing, depth requirements)
4. Clearance requirements (heat dissipation, cable access)
5. Connection requirements (how it interfaces with other components)

Output strict JSON format:
{
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "component_identifier",
      "dimensions": {"length": 0, "width": 0, "height": 0},
      "ports": [
        {"type": "usb-c", "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}, "orientation": "front"}
      ],
      "mounting": {
        "holes": [{"diameter": 2.5, "positions": [{"x": 0, "y": 0}]}],

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Complexity Creep**: Multi-agent system becomes too complex
   - *Mitigation*: Phased implementation with validation gates
   
2. **Performance Degradation**: Multiple AI calls slow down pipeline
   - *Mitigation*: Parallel processing and caching strategies
   
3. **Cost Increase**: More AI API calls increase operational costs
   - *Mitigation*: Optimize prompts, implement smart caching
   
4. **Quality Regression**: New system performs worse than current
   - *Mitigation*: A/B testing and gradual rollout

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Integration Complexity**: Difficult to integrate new agents
2. **Validation Accuracy**: Assembly validation may have false positives
3. **User Experience**: More complex pipeline may confuse users
