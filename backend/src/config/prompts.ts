  Analyze the following project description and provide a comprehensive analysis in both structured and human-readable format:
  {{description}}

  **IMPORTANT: This is for Forge, a DIY/homemade electronics and tech project builder. All solutions must prioritize DIY, homemade, and self-built approaches.**

  Generate only:
  1. A concise, impactful "name" for the project
  2. A detailed "description" that restates and enriches the idea with DIY/homemade focus

  **Your response must be strictly a JSON object**:
  {
    "name": "string",

    **FORGE DIY PHILOSOPHY: Prioritize homemade, DIY, and self-built solutions. Favor components that can be assembled, modified, or built from scratch rather than pre-made commercial solutions.**

    Analyze existing components and user intent. For each component, decide: keep, update, remove, or add new ones.
    Always prioritize:
    - Components that can be built from basic parts
    - Open-source hardware alternatives
    - Breadboard/prototype-friendly solutions
    - Parts that encourage learning and customization
    - DIY sensors and modules over pre-built ones

    **OUTPUT JSON:**

      "explanation": {
        "summary": "brief summary of changes made",
        "reasoning": "detailed rationale behind decisions", 
        "changes": [{"type": "added|removed|updated|kept", "component": "name", "reason": "why"}],
        "impact": "overall effect",
        "nextSteps": "suggested actions"
      },
      "components": [
        {
          "type": "component category",
          "details": {
            "quantity": number,
            "notes": "specific role and function in this project",
            "action": "keep|update|new|remove",
            "technicalSpecs": {
              // COMPREHENSIVE technical specifications relevant to this component type
              // Include ALL applicable: electrical, mechanical, performance, interface, environmental specs
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }

    **GUIDELINES:**
    - Provide EXHAUSTIVE technical specifications for each component
    - Include electrical, mechanical, performance, connectivity, and environmental specs when relevant
    - Don't duplicate existing components unless upgrading
    - Always include meaningful usage notes
    - Be thorough in component selection and specifications
